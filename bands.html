   Before I start the list, I would like to clarify, that by this list I am <U>NOT</U> saying that one band is worse than the other. 
   <B> I love them all. </B>
   The more I listen to the band currently, the higher it will be on my list. But you should know I listen to solo artists way more than to bands.
   <BR> Lets begin!

   <B> What I have to say: </B> I must admit that I started listening to them mostly because of a TV series called Yellowjackets. If you know, you know. I listen to them less now that Yellowjackets new season has already aired. But I still see soulcrushing edits with their songs on Tik Tok.

   <B> What I have to say: </B> I came across this band randomly on Spotify by listening to their song Dont Delete The Kisses. I loved it! My biggest regret is that, when they were performing on Pohoda festival I didnt attend their concert :(. I didnt know them back then, but I would love to see them play now.
